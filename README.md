# AFT_TVC_PIC: Vignette

This vignette reproduces the results in the simulation section from our submitted article:

*A maximum penalised likelihood approach for semiparametric accelerated failure time models with time-varying covariates and partly interval censoring*. 

A. Bhaskaran, D. Ma, B. Liquet-Weiland, S. N. Lo, S. Heritier and J. Ma.

Hence, this vignette begins by providing details for simulating data from semiparametric accelerated failure time models with time-varying covariates and partly interval censoring. It will be followed by our maximum penalised likelihood approach to fitting the model and inference on the estimated quantities.
